What happened is that some coefficients being zero isn't necessarily due to regularization. It could be that those coefficients were just not useful in the first place. To really compare ridge and lasso, we have to see how the coefficients change when we change `alpha`."

So L2-regularization in ridge regression does not result in feature selection like it did with LASSO. So what is it good for? Even though L2-regularization doesn't necessarily reduce the number of features, it is still regularization, which means that it helps us fight against overfitting."
